## Comparison
I found working with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to be a smoother experience overall. The deployment process felt more straightforward, and testing the HTTP function was quick and intuitive. In contrast, Azure required extra setup where I had to disable secret protection to successfully push my code to GitHub, which made the workflow more complex. However, I did appreciate Azureâ€™s built-in live testing feature within the portal, which made verifying function behavior convenient once everything was configured.
